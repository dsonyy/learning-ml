# Machine Learning Stuff

There is a list of my uploaded projects and exercises (from the latest to the oldest):

- **Simplest numpy Neural Network** - 3 Layers, each one consists of a single neuron; on input recieves 0 or 1, on output puts the same value as input (yeah, unbelievable). Implements simple gradient descent and backpropagation ideas.

- [**Orange**](https://orange.biolab.si/) - Exercises and tutorials from the original Orange's website and CoderDojo workshops.
