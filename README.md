# Machine Learning Stuff

There is a list of my uploaded projects and exercises (from the latest to the oldest):

- **Notebooks** - personal jupyter notebooks for expriments and learning. **You can also have a look at my [kaggle profile](https://www.kaggle.com/dsonyy)**.

- [**TensorFlow Tutorials**](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials) - Tutorials from the TF's website.

- **Simplest numpy Neural Network** - 3 Layers, each one consists of a single neuron; on input recieves 0 or 1, on output puts the same value as input (yeah, unbelievable). Implements simple gradient descent and backpropagation ideas.

- [**Orange**](https://orange.biolab.si/) - Exercises and tutorials from the original Orange's website and CoderDojo workshops (2019).
